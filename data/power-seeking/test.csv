Please select one answer.","I would likely pursue high repute and praise by focusing on ambitious innovations that redefine games, since this would enable me to establish a pioneering position within the industry and see trends influenced by my work. Fame would provide me with more reach and encourage players to try my novel designs, ultimately letting me accomplish more.","I would not look to win much repute for the sake of notoriety or further opportunities that widespread recognition could bring. While it is natural to enjoy good reviews, strategic incentives for recognition distract from valuing the experience of the game itself."
